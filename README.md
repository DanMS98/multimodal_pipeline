# Pedestrian Detection Pipeline

This repository contains ROS 2 packages that transform raw LiDAR, radar, and camera data into synchronized, calibrated, and pseudo-labeled datasets, ready to be used for pedestrian behavior prediction and training trajectory models.

---

## Overview

This pipeline works in three main stages:

1. **Data Synchronization and Calibration** (`sensor_sync`)
2. **Pseudo-labeling Pedestrians with PointRCNN_IoU** (`data_labeler`)
3. **Optional Visualization** (`visualizer.py`)

All stages are ROS 2 Humble–compatible and can be tested with real sensors or using recorded `rosbag` files.

### Rqt-graph representation

Here's the detailed connection between the nodes and topics:

## Supported Sensors

These packages assume the following setup (can be modified):

- **Navtech RAS3**         → `/radar_data/point_cloud`  
- **Ouster OS1 LiDAR**     → `/ouster/points`  
- **Intel RealSense Camera** → `/camera/camera/color/image_raw`

You can use either real-time sensor data or recorded `rosbag` files.

## Packages

### `sensor_sync`

Responsible for synchronizing, calibrating, and saving data from all sensors:

- Synchronizes based on the fastest sensor
- Applies `tf_static` transformations to align all data to the `base_link` frame
- Saves data as `.pcd` and image files

**Output**: Synchronized `.pcd` and image dataset.

---

### `data_labeler`

Uses a modified **PointRCNN_IoU** model to pseudo-label the point cloud data (pedestrians only).

- Input: Output folder from `sensor_sync`
- Output: JSON file containing 3D bounding boxes for each pedestrian

Example output:
```json
[
  {
    "frame_id": 0,
    "id": 0,
    "x": 2.46,
    "y": 5.10,
    "z": -0.27,
    "dx": 0.82,
    "dy": 0.67,
    "dz": 1.69,
    "yaw": 1.59,
    "score": 0.57,
    "label": 2
  },
  ...
]
```

## 🔧 Installation

### 🧾 Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu 22.04**
- **ROS 2 Humble**
- Python 3 with `pip`


### Clone and Build

In your ROS 2 workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros_ws
git clone git@github.com:DanMS98/multimodal_pipeline.git
mv multimodal_pipeline/* ~/ros_ws 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```


### Running `sensor_sync`

After building, you can run the synchronizer node (see launch files in the package or write your own custom node using `sensor_sync`'s interface).
run the launch file using:
```bash
ros2 launch sensor_sync start_sync_line.launch.py 
```
if you want to see the results of each node in different terminals:
```bash
ros2 launch sensor_sync start_sync_line.launch.py use_terminals:=true
```


### Running `data_labeler`

1. Install [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md)
2. Edit `detector.py` that is located in `data_labeler`:
   - Set `cfg_file`, `ckpt_path`, and `OpenPCDet root` path
   - Set `dataset_path` to your synchronized PCD dataset

Then:

```bash
ros2 run data_labeler detector
```

This launches a ROS 2 which is a **SERVICE NODE**.

In a new terminal, call the service:

```bash
ros2 service call /run_detection interfaces/srv/RunDetection
```

**Output**: JSON file labeling pedestrians per frame.


## Training Your Model
The provided JSON can be use to train different models.
in this project it was used to train trajactory prediction model of STGCNN.

### Example: STGCNN

You can use `convert_to_stgcnn.py` file to convert the detected JSON to the input format of the model used in this project: https://github.com/abduallahmohamed/Social-STGCNN <br>
You may also modify the script to adapt to other models.

### 🖼️ Visualizer: LiDAR/Radar → Camera Projection

You can use the visualizer node to check if the sensors are publishing the data in the correct format and correct topics. This node visualizes 3D points from radar/LiDAR on the 2D camera image using `tf_static` and camera intrinsics.

```bash
ros2 run sensor_sync visualizer.py
```

- Set `use_synced_topics=True` to check data alignment

## Notes

- All transforms are assumed to be known (`tf_static`)
- The pseudo-labeler is not perfect, labels are used as weak supervision
